Bayes-Swarm is a research project, its aim is to spider web sources (news portals, blogs and online newspapers) and extract correlations between such sources.

### Important ###
Bayes-Swarm is no longer under active development. The http://www.bayes-swarm.com no longer hosts the spider frontend interface.

Feel free to navigate the documentation and use the code for your own purposes, just don't expect many new features to be released...

For any info, including access to spidered data (roughly 8Gb of tar gzipped pages, equivalent to roughly 3yr homepages of the main Italian and foreign newspaper homepages), please contact **info@bayesfor.eu**.

### More about the project ###
The project name, **swarm**, is a suggestion about its core value: the ability to extract a global quantitative meaning from apprently meaningless elements (such as single words), just in the same way a swarm behaves in a coherent way even if the behaviour of the single insect is erratic.
Learn more about Bayes-Swarm in the GetStarted page.
