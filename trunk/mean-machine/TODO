TODO:

* merge every component in a single slick killer application:
  - code cleanup:
    - move xapian code from mainwindow.py to core.py
    - add db to search_options when is_valid is triggered
    - send keep alives in case of remote db
  - handle possible errors with queries/timeouts of the server
  - add a stop button
  - share db ListStore at app level
  - freeze component specific controls when doing searches or when
    result frame is not realized
  - add proper log messages
  - show error/warning messages in statusbar
  - show matched documents for all components, allow to toggle this with a 
    button, double click on document should open a pane of it with a renderer
  - when openining a new component, put cursor in the search box, allow return
    key to trigger search
  - check if a new version is present, offer to update

* graphnew component
  - show min vertex size = min avg term freq and 
      max vertex size = max avg term freq
  - show min edge size = 0 and max edge size = 1
  - add a save graph image button (include search parameters in picture
    metada)
  - center the searched term in the graph
  - allow to switch between distance graph and matching graph (current
    bs-xapian-graph view based on xapian weight only)
