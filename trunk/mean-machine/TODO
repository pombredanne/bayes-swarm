TODO:

* merge every component in a single slick killer application:
  - each component is a different tab
  - share search ui among components (add: source, time, db, number of
    docs to retrieve, n. of docs for rset, n. of terms for eset)
  - leave specific parameters inside each component (ie threshold for
    nearest-plotter)
  - add proper log messages
  - remove 'search when you type', add a search button + progressbar
    
* bs-xapian-index.py:
  - add source info as document value, so that it can be used for
    filtering during visualization

* bs-xapian-search.py:
  - status bar
  - filter tags as you type (re-run eset with updated filter)

* bs-xapian-graph.py:
  - integrate clicking functionality with nearest-plotter and remove
  
* bs-xapian-nearest.py:
  - add a proper command line interface so that it can be used
    standalone or as a library
    
* bs-nearest-plotter.py:
  - add a search box
  - use seed in order to stabilize graphs
  - center the searched term in the graph
  - allow to switch between distance graph and matching graph (current
    bs-xapian-graph view based on xapian weight only)
