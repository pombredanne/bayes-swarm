TODO:

* merge every component in a single slick killer application:
  - clear result window if no results are returned
  - share db list at app level
  - share search ui among components (add: source, time, db, number of
    docs to retrieve, n. of docs for rset, n. of terms for eset)
  - leave specific parameters inside each component (ie threshold for
    nearest-plotter)
  - add proper log messages
  - improve progressbar
  - show error/warning messages in statusbar

* graph component
  - add an export button on graph component
  - use seed in order to stabilize graphs
  - center the searched term in the graph
  - allow to switch between distance graph and matching graph (current
    bs-xapian-graph view based on xapian weight only)

* search component
  - time-machine like functionality
  
* bs-xapian-index.py:
  - add source info as document value, so that it can be used for
    filtering during visualization

* bs-xapian-graph.py:
  - integrate clicking functionality with nearest-plotter and remove
