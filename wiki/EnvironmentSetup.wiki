Please, spend some seconds reading the [Architecture] document before. 

= Software Requirements =
You need the following softwares and elements to get started on the project :

  * a relational database, [http://www.mysql.com/ MySql] ( version 5 or later ) is recommended.
  * a [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ ruby] interpreter. We are currently using version 1.8.6 or later
  * the [http://rubygems.org/ rubygems] packaging system, to install the additional required libraries
  * optionally, the [http://www.r-project.org/ R] environment if you want to perform extra analyses on the data. You may want to consider the [http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/RMySQL.html RMySQL] library to connect R directly with the MySql database.
  * the FreeDataset, a publicly available version of the bayes-swarm dataset, that you can use to get started with bayes-swarm development. See DatabaseSetup for info on how to setup such dataset.

= Install Instructions =

== Linux: Ubuntu ==

=== MySql ===
Install mysql with apt-get:
{{{
sudo apt-get install mysql-server-5.0 mysql-client-5.0
}}}

=== Ruby ===
Install ruby, rubygems and the required gems (the list shown below is incomplete):
 
{{{
sudo apt-get install ruby irb ri rdoc ruby1.8-dev rubygems tidy
sudo gem update --system
sudo gem install rails
sudo gem install ferret
sudo gem install tidy
...
}}}

mysql/ruby bindings :
{{{
sudo apt-get install libmysql-ruby1.8
}}}

=== R ===
{{{
sudo apt-get install r-base
}}}

*warning*: you need to use R commands to install RMySql package (http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/RMySQL.html)

== Mac Os X ==

=== MySql ===
Download one of the available MySql packages for Mac Os X directly from the www.mysql.com website . Install it by double-clicking on the package and following the onscreen instructions. 

=== Ruby ===
You may follow this guide to set up your ruby / mysql environment :
  * Mac Os 10.4 : http://hivelogic.com/articles/2007/02/ruby-rails-mongrel-mysql-osx
  * Mac Os 10.5 : http://hivelogic.com/articles/2008/02/ruby-rails-leopard

Once you have installed ruby and rubygems, you should have the binaries installed in `/usr/local/bin` . You can then update your installation to the most recent version and install the required libraries : 

{{{
sudo gem update --system
sudo gem install rails
sudo gem install ferret
sudo gem install tidy
}}}

=== R ===
To install R, just use the official dmg provided at http://www.r-project.org/ . 

== Windows ==
*TODO* : this section is still missing. 

= Database Setup =
Now that your local development environment is ready, you can populate it with the FreeDataset . You can tune your Mysql installation using the instructions in DatabaseSetup .

= Source code checkout =
bayes-swarm uses [http://subversion.tigris.org Subversion] to manage the source code for the project. Once you have installed subversion on your machine, you can download a copy of the source code executing the following command from the command line of your OS:

{{{
svn checkout http://bayes-swarm.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ bayes-swarm
}}}

It will create a folder named `bayes-swarm` which will contain all the project sources.
