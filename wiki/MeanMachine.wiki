#summary Mean-Machine is the indexing of Bayes-Swarm db via xapian

= Introduction =

Mean Machine is an experimental sub-project, named as the famous Sugar Ray's song, that consists in indexing the Bayes-Swarm [FreeDataset pagestore] with the [http://www.xapian.org Xapian] library.

= Details =

Mean-Machine, like every xapian program consists of two distinct phases:
  * Indexing
  * Searching

= Indexing =

That's what bs-xapian-index.py does. Just indicate the path to a pagestore and it will do the rest. Xapian can index text in a very smart way, i.e. remembers each word position so that when you search you can find pattern like "clinton NEAR health" or even more complex.

= Searching =

We have currently two search GUIs: bs-xapian-search-gtk.py and bs-xapian-graph.py

== bs-xapian-search-gtk.py ==

The user can insert terms to be searched, as a result the most relevant documents are presented together with a cloud of the most relevant words. Clicking on the words allows to deepen the search and find the documents which match both words.

== bs-xapian-graph.py ==
[http://bayes-swarm.googlecode.com/svn/images/bs-xapian-graph.png http://bayes-swarm.googlecode.com/svn/images/bs-xapian-graph_small.png]

The user can insert terms to be searched, the program paints a graph of the 10 most connected words, ie the words which are more likely found with what the user entered. By typing more words (or by clicking on one of the nodes), the program searchs for matching words for each of the terms which are entered.

= What do I need to try it? =
  * Mean-Machine source from svn
  * xapian indexed db (can be found at [http://www.battlehorse.net/swarm_sample/ this url])
  * xapian library with python bindings
  * pygtk

== Ubuntu ==
Install xapian and its python bindings
{{{
sudo apt-get install python-xapian
}}}

pygtk is already installed on the system.

Get the source code
{{{
cd ~
svn checkout http://bayes-swarm.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/mean-machine mean-machine
}}}

Download the sample db
{{{
cd ~
mkdir xapian-pagestore
cd xapian-pagestore
wget http://www.battlehorse.net/swarm_sample/2008_01xap.tar.bz2
}}}
