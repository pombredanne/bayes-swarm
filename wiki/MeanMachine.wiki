#summary Mean-Machine is the indexing of Bayes-Swarm db via xapian

= Introduction =

Since we were not happy with our current self-made indexing, we're doing experiments with xapian. This sub-project is called Mean Machine like a famous Sugar Ray's song.

= Details =

Mean-Machine, like every xapian program consists of two distinct phases:
  * Indexing
  * Searching

= Indexing =

That's what bs-xapian-index.py does. Just indicate the path to a pagestore and it will do the rest.

= Searching =

We have currently two search GUIs: bs-xapian-search-gtk.py and bs-xapian-graph.py
