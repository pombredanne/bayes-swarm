*What I like of Prototype 1:*

   * it is working!!!!!
   * the web page is essential but it is nice looking. I'll try to keep the "minimal"   flavor also in the next versions. 
   * the graphs are not fancy but they are clear unless we plot too many lines together

*What I don't like of Prototype 1:*

   * it doesn't read full articles, just titles and the very first lines of the full text.
   * the average count of words per day is about 10, we can't do any stat yet!!
   * move the nerdy stuff to a private page. I won't let anyone doing queries directly to the db
  * there is no Italian support


*My suggestions are:*

  * move to RSS. RSS give direct access to title, link, date and description of any article that is cited in the home pages.
  * the table "source" should contain entities that are related to news companies ( like BBC, Corriere, ...) and not to news aggregators ( like google.news ). For example we want to compare how much Repubblica and Corriere covered a subject. We can use news aggregetors to update the "sources" table.
  * read full length articles, using the link provided by RSS home pages. This will increase significantly the word counts.
  * wrap up these modifications, build a Prototype 1.1 and publish it.
