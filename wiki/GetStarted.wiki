Bayes-Swarm's aim is to spider web sources (news portals, blogs and online newspapers) and extract correlations between such sources.

The engine will search correlations both in space (correlation among different sources) and time (correlation between the contents of a same source in different instant of times). Probabilistic theory and bayesian model will be used to extract such correlations.

The engine will extract relevant informations from correlation analysis, such as quantitative measurement of difference in opinions among sources which deal with the same argument.

=== Architecture ===
The [Architecture] document describes the architecture used by the *bayes-swarm* engine.

=== Environment Setup ===
The first thing you need to do is to setup your pc to properly work with the project sources. You can follow the instructions described in EnvironmentSetup . 

=== Prototypes ===
Once your pc is ready, you can start trying some of our prototypes. Here follows the list of available ones : 

  * PrototypeOne : the very first approach to page data extraction. Currently being used for day-to-day extractions.
  * PrototypeTwo : an ETL structured way to data extraction. Still not in active use.

=== Data Simulation ===
The TestSupport page describes the available resources to simulate data, instead of effectively extracting them.

== Live demo ==
You can try a live demo at http://www.bayes-swarm.com/

Please note: the demo is still rough and almost for internal-use only.
