You need the following softwares and elements to get started on the project :

= Database =
The database of choice is [http://www.mysql.com/ MySql] (version 5 or later).

You may want to use some database management tool to work with it. We suggest [http://www.minq.se/products/dbvis/ DBVisualizer] , or [http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/gui-tools/5.0.html MySql GUI Tools] .

== Ubuntu ==
{{{
sudo apt-get install mysql-server-5.0 mysql-client-5.0
}}}

= Extraction Engine =
The engine which performs data extraction, initial analysis and database storage is written in [http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/ ruby]. 
In addition to ruby, you may require some additional libraries, therefore you should also install the [http://rubygems.org/ rubygems] packaging system. 

The list of required libraries will be sorted out one day or another. For the moment refer to current prototype requirements , starting from PrototypeOne . 

== Ubuntu ==
{{{
sudo apt-get install ruby irb ri rdoc ruby1.8-dev rubygems tidy
sudo gem update --system
sudo gem install --remote ferret --include-dependencies
sudo gem install --remote tidy --include-dependencies
}}}

= Analysis Engine =
The language of choice is [http://www.r-project.org/ R], wich provides, among other nice things like time series and cluster analysis, [http://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Descriptions/RMySQL.html RMySQL] an interface to MySql databates.
