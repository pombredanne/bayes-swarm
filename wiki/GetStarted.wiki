#labels Phase-Deploy

== Environment Setup ==
The first thing you need to do is to setup your pc to properly work with the project sources. You can follow the instructions described in EnvironmentSetup . 

== Prototypes ==
Once your pc is ready, you can start trying some of our prototypes. Here follows the list of available ones : 

  * PrototypeOne : the very first approach to page data extraction
  * PrototypeTwo : an ETL structured way to data extraction. Browser-guidance techniques are involved in page content analysis.

== Data Simulation ==
The TestSupport page describes the available resources to simulate data, instead of effectively extracting them.

== Live demos ==
You can try a live demo at http://kate.homeunix.net/bayesfor/website.py/

A note of *warning* : the demo is still rough and almost for internal-use only. Try not making damage to it, if you can.
