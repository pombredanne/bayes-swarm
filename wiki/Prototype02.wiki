#How To Use

* Instructions *

Before running version .2:
   * build a new database using schema_new.db ( you find it in the db directory ). The new db will be called "bayesfor". Eventually add some words to the "int_words" table.
   * run just once "load_source.rb". This will uplaod the table "SOURCES" of the db.

To run version .2 :
   * ruby wrapper.py

* Description *

   * check the news from sources ( 5 italian newspapers )
   * for every new link, add it to the "PAGES" table with flag 0
   * read every link from "PAGES"
         * if flag == 0, run swarm and change flag to 1
         * if flag == 1, passn

* Note *

   * version .2 add every article link to the tables "PAGES" of the db that may become huge after a while...
