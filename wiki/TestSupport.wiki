This document describes the available resources to perform tests and simulations on the bayes-swarm algorithms. 

The current ruby scripts can be used to support testing :
  * generate.rb : generates x-y values according to user-specified math functions. Can apply gaussian distortions to generated data ( to simulate noise ) and normalization functions.
  * persist.rb : uses the data generated by the previous script to generate test loads for the bayes-swarm database.

= Persist.rb =
Generates records for the bayes-swarm database containing statistics about words according to the bayes-swarm definition. This tool can be used for testing purposes to load the bayes-swarm database with fictional data which can be statistically analyzed and tested.

For example, it can generate a simulated word count for a given word over a period of time. It depends on the `generate.rb` script for the statistical distribution of generated data.

This script is launched from the command line and writes on the standard output. The generated output is composed of `INSERT` statements which can be used to load a relational database such a MySql . 

The script requires a standard `ruby` installation. No additional modules or gems.

Consider the following command line
{{{
./persist.rb -w newyork -t 20070801 -e count --generator -f smooth_sin -n 100 -s 0.1 -r 0:100
}}}

It will generate `100` entries for the `WORDS` table of the bayes-swarm database. These entries will be relative to the word `newyork` and will simulate the `count` of words extracted from a fictional webpage starting from `2007-08-01` and onward. The count of words will vary according to a `smoothed sin` distribution. Values will be comprised in the range `0 - 100` and each generated value will have a gaussian distortion with `sigma = 0.1` to add noise to the generation function. 

The output will be something like this :
{{{
INSERT INTO words (page_id,scantime,name,count) VALUES (1,'2007-08-01','newyork',100);
INSERT INTO words (page_id,scantime,name,count) VALUES (1,'2007-08-02','newyork',65);
INSERT INTO words (page_id,scantime,name,count) VALUES (1,'2007-08-03','newyork',71);
INSERT INTO words (page_id,scantime,name,count) VALUES (1,'2007-08-04','newyork',53);
INSERT INTO words (page_id,scantime,name,count) VALUES (1,'2007-08-05','newyork',83);
...
}}}

The variation of word count across time will be something like this (note that the smooth sin pattern fades into noise due to the gaussian distortion )

Generating multiple word series with different starting times can simulate dependency among words (note that gaussian distortion is almost absent in this example) :
