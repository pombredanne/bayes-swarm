#summary Usage instructions and informations for Prototype 1
#labels Phase-Prototype

= Introduction =

Prototype1 is an early technology preview about data extraction from webpages.

= Requirements =

Prototype1 depends on :
* Ferret : a search library / indexer / stemmer for the ruby language
* Tidy : a markup cleaner for HTML pages

= How it works =
Prototype1 works as follows : 
* extracts web page contents from the URL passed as parameter
* cleans the content fixing up invalid markup with tidy
* strips html tags and entities
* performs stemming of the remaining words (the page content)
* returns the most frequent stems ( this is what Prototype1 considers the 'page relevant informations' )

= Stemmer details =
section to be completed 

= Test cases =
Works well with wikipedia pages (high content cohesion, minimun garbage and noise)
Works bad with newspapers (low content cohesion) or general purpose sites (lots of noise)

= Improvements =
Consider other ways to perform content extraction : identify html headers and / or content positioning within the page.
Consider removal of 'context-words' ( such as 'news', 'newspaper', 'article' for an online news site ) and keep only 'rare' words.
