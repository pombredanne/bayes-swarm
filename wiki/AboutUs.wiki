Born in 1979, with a university background in physics and a general interest in scientific matters, I am a technology-addict with an outstanding passion for computer science and programming. Currently working as system analyst in the IPTV field, my focus is about datamining behaviours and patterns from IPTV portals data.

I joined the *bayes-swarm* project as _technology expert_ to help in writing code and extraction algorithms.
